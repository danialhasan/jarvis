## üß† Understanding Claude Code's Memory Model

### Stateless Sessions
**Important**: Claude Code is stateless - each conversation starts fresh with no memory of previous sessions.

**What this means**:
- No persistent context between sessions
- Each `claude` command starts a new conversation
- Previous conversations are not automatically remembered

### Persistence Solutions

#### Option 1: Simple File-Based Storage (RECOMMENDED TO START)
Store your data in markdown files that Claude can read/write:

```bash
# Create a knowledge base
mkdir ~/jarvis-knowledge
echo "# My Work Context" > ~/jarvis-knowledge/context.md
echo "# Meeting Notes" > ~/jarvis-knowledge/meetings.md
echo "# Contact List" > ~/jarvis-knowledge/contacts.md
```

**Usage Example**:
```
# In Claude Code:
"Read my context.md file and update it with today's meeting outcomes"
"Add this new contact to my contacts.md file"
"Review my meetings.md and suggest follow-ups needed"
```

#### Option 2: Supabase Database (FULL CRM SYSTEM)
For advanced users who want a complete CRM like Danial's setup:

```bash
# Add Supabase MCP server
claude mcp add supabase "npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest --access-token YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Benefits of Supabase**:
- Structured data with relationships
- Advanced querying capabilities  
- Real-time sync across devices
- Web dashboard for data management
- Scalable for business growth

**See [`SUPABASE_SETUP.md`](./SUPABASE_SETUP.md) guide for complete CRM setup**

### When to Upgrade
- **Start with**: Markdown files in ~/jarvis-knowledge/
- **Upgrade when**: You have 50+ contacts or need structured data
- **Full CRM when**: Managing business relationships systematically

## üõ† Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install Node.js (if not already installed)

```bash
# Check if Node.js is installed
node --version

# If not installed, install via Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install node
```

### Step 2: Install Claude Code

```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify installation
claude --version
```

### Step 3: Set Up Anthropic API Key

1. Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

```bash
# Set up your API key (replace with your actual key)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"

# Make it permanent by adding to your shell profile
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 4: Configure MCP Servers

Claude Code uses MCP servers to connect to external services. We'll set up the core integrations:

#### Calendar Integration (iCal)
```bash
# Add calendar MCP server
claude mcp add ical-server mcp-ical
```
**üìö Documentation**: [mcp-ical GitHub](https://github.com/Omar-V2/mcp-ical) - Detailed setup and troubleshooting

#### Gmail Integration
```bash
# Add Gmail MCP server with auto-authentication
claude mcp add gmail "npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp"
```
**üìö Documentation**: [Gmail MCP Server](https://github.com/gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp) - OAuth setup and commands

#### Optional: Additional Useful Servers
```bash
# Memory for persistent knowledge
claude mcp add memory "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
```
**üìö Documentation**: [Memory Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory) - Knowledge persistence

```bash
# Linear for task management (if you use Linear)
claude mcp add Linear "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"
```
**üìö Documentation**: [Linear MCP](https://mcp.linear.app) - Task and project management

```bash
# Supabase for database operations
claude mcp add supabase "npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest --access-token YOUR_TOKEN"
```

- [Claude Code Troubleshooting](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/troubleshooting) - Official troubleshooting guide

### Step 5: Gmail Authentication Setup

The Gmail MCP server requires OAuth authentication:

```bash
# Navigate to a working directory
mkdir ~/jarvis-workspace
cd ~/jarvis-workspace

# Start Claude Code (this will trigger Gmail auth on first use)
claude
```

When you first try to use Gmail functions, you'll be prompted to authenticate:
1. A browser window will open automatically
2. Sign in to your Google account
3. Grant permissions for Calendar and Gmail access
4. Return to terminal - authentication will be saved

## üéØ First Commands to Try

Once everything is set up, try these commands in Claude Code:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Then try these natural language commands:
"Show me my calendar for today"
"Find my latest 5 emails"
"Draft an email to [person] about [topic]"
"What meetings do I have this week?"
"Send me a summary of my day"
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Calendar Test
```
# In Claude Code session:
"What's on my calendar today?"
```
You should see your calendar events listed.

### Gmail Test
```
# In Claude Code session:
"Show me my latest emails"
```
You should see recent email subjects and senders.

### Integration Test
```
# In Claude Code session:
"Find emails about meetings in my calendar this week"
```
This tests both integrations working together.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom MCP Server Settings

Your MCP servers are configured in Claude's settings. You can check the configuration:

```bash
# View current MCP configuration
claude mcp list
```

### Environment Variables

Add these to your shell profile for persistence:

```bash
# Edit your shell profile
nano ~/.zshrc

# Add these lines:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export CLAUDE_MCP_GMAIL_ENABLED=true
export CLAUDE_MCP_ICAL_ENABLED=true

# Save and reload
source ~/.zshrc
```

## üì± Usage Examples

### Email Workflows
```bash
# Draft and send emails
"Draft an email to john@example.com about the quarterly review meeting"

# Search and manage
"Find all emails from last week about the project proposal"
"Mark all emails from newsletter@company.com as read"
```

### Calendar Workflows
```bash
# Meeting management
"Schedule a 30-minute meeting with Sarah next Tuesday at 2pm"
"What's my availability this Friday afternoon?"

# Analysis and prep
"Analyze my calendar for next week and suggest time blocks for deep work"
"Create a prep document for my 3pm meeting based on email context"
```

### Combined Workflows
```bash
# Cross-system automation
"Based on my calendar, draft follow-up emails for meetings that happened today"
"Find emails related to my upcoming meetings and summarize key points"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Claude Code Safety & Guardrails

### Built-in Safety Features
Claude Code has safety measures to prevent dangerous operations:

**Protected Commands**:
- `rm -rf /` or similar destructive file operations
- System-level modifications that could break your computer
- Network operations that could compromise security
- Dangerous sudo commands

**Permission System**:
- Claude asks for confirmation before making significant changes
- File modifications show diffs before applying
- Git operations require explicit approval

### Autonomous Mode (Advanced Users Only)
```bash
# CAUTION: Only for experienced users
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Use with extreme caution**:
- Bypasses safety confirmations
- Can make system modifications without asking
- Intended for experienced developers who understand the risks
- **Recommendation**: Never use unless you fully understand the implications

### Safe Usage Guidelines
1. **Start conservatively**: Use default safety settings
2. **Review changes**: Always check file diffs before approving
3. **Backup important data**: Git repositories, config files
4. **Understand commands**: If unsure what Claude wants to do, ask for explanation

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Command not found: claude"**
```bash
# Reinstall Claude Code
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**2. Gmail authentication fails**
```bash
# Clear OAuth cache and re-authenticate
rm -rf ~/.config/@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp
# Then restart Claude and try Gmail commands again
```

**3. Calendar not showing events**
```bash
# Check calendar permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Calendars
# Make sure Terminal has calendar access
```

**4. MCP server connection issues**
```bash
# Check MCP server status
claude mcp list

# Remove and re-add problematic servers
claude mcp remove gmail
claude mcp add gmail "npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp"
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
